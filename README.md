# Email Contact List Updater

As a part of my internship, I was matched with [Convessa](http://convessa.com/) - an enterprise-grade voice platform that enables the development of extensive, robust and scalable voice applications. One of my first tasks was to dive into the capabilities offered by email marketing platforms such as [Mailjet](https://dev.mailjet.com/). This small program constructs JSON Objects with contact information, custom segmentation properties, and unique identifiers to programmatically update user information in bulk.
